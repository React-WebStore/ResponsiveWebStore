# React Responsive Web Store

Hi reader,

I have created this repository because I have been developing web stores for the past 3 years.
I've never found a great NPM package for running a utilizing React.
I know there are propably a million other tools for creating a webstore but I wanted to create one 
that can be integrated with any stack.

A single package that provides you a database to store your items, an analytics dashboard and a one stop shop for your webstore.

The idea is to have a shippable NPM package for a store, an admin portal with analytics showing you which products are the best sellers, 
integration with major website like Amazon, Ebay, FB marketplace so you can push out products to all of your channels at the same time.
Keep track of your inventory and see reviews on your products from several different sources.

This sounds like a lot, therefor I want to start with a simple responsive and integrable NPM package for React user to build out there one stop shop
Start conquering the ecommerce world with React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
